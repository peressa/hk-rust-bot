# Rust+ Desktop App (Unofficial)



⚠️ **Note**: This is an **unofficial** project and is not affiliated with Facepunch Studios or the game *Rust*.  

It is open source so anyone can verify there is **no malware or hidden components**.

⚠️ **Note**: If you used it for a while and can't pair new servers anymore, simply click on the Pairing button with right mouse button and select to delete the config file.

---


## 🔍 What is this?



The **Rust+ Desktop App** is a Windows application built on the official Rust+ Companion API.  

It lets you pair Rust servers, monitor in-game events, control Smart Devices, and view dynamic map markers — all on your PC.
By now it's more than 'just' Rust Plus. It's Rust² you could say... That's why this is our new icon ;) Was about time.
![Update](./icon.png)  


The app ships as a single installer (bundling .NET, Node.js, WebView2 runtime, RustPlusAPI, etc.), so you don’t have to install dependencies manually.

*(click the image to watch on YouTube)*
## Update Notes 3.3.1 (February 16th 26)
- **New Pre Deep Sea Notification:** Before Deep Sea is triggered, you can get a notification in Team Chat (around 3 minutes ahead of actual spawn) -> note that the direction will always be shown in West - this is not the actual spawn location. It's just coming from the fact that Deep Sea shops have negative X-coordinates. 
- **Stability Patch:** Even on weak servers the connection should now be more stable and smart devices should work more reliably. Reduced duplicate chat fetches, made shop search and shops more stable with caching icons to local drive.

## Update Notes 3.3.0 (January 18th 26)
- **New Oilrig Countdown:** When Oilrig is triggered, a crate icon with the remaining time appears on the map. Optional Team Chat notifications remind your team every 5 minutes until the crate unlocks.
- **Leader Auto-Promote:** No more AFK leaders! Team members can now type `!leader` in chat to be instantly promoted to team leader (requires current leader to have the app open).

## Update Notes 3.2.1 (November 21st 25)
- You can now share Smart Devices with your team! No more pairing in-game needed. 
  One guy who pairs the devices is enough - rest of the team just imports with 1 click.

## Update Notes 3.1.2 (November 17th 25)
Version 3.1.2 brings full Storage Monitor integration and the following optimizations:
![Update](./3.1.0.png)  
- Shop alerts now also trigger when item was sold out and then comes back online
- Storage Monitor shows traffic light upkeep indicator (from 1 hr. and less)
- Map can be zoomed with NUM +/-
- No duplicate chat notifications when server had been desynced for a short amount of time

## Update Notes 3.0.0 (October 30th 25)
- FULL Shop Analytics Overhaul!
  This comes with instant check for profit trades, trade route check (Buy X for Y) and more
- Map Overlay
  You can draw, set markers, share your map markers with team mates
- Shop Alarm system
  Get alerts (in chat or audio alerts) when a new shop pops up or when a suspicious shop disappeared or when your desired item is back in stock
- new Patch Notes Button with all new features explained

... and more


## Update Notes 2.0.5 (October 6th 25)
- Global Device Hotkeys are here! Assign one key to multiple devices to group them together.
- new Update Button (Bug: reads current version as 0.0.0 so it will always find an update - will be fixed in the future)
- new Pairing possibility through Edge Browser + better Logs
- Mini Map Overlay for ingame use
- Crosshair Overlay
- Team Management
- Camera Support
- Promoting Teammember to Leader
- Death Markers
- Grid Corrections
- Notifications in Chat for Deaths, Spawns, Online, Offline
- added fetching icon symbols from rusthelp.com (including Blueprint Fragments)

- Please report other issues in the [Issues section](../../issues)

---



## 🛠️ Installation & Setup



1. **Download & install**  

   - Get the installer from **[Releases](../../releases/latest)** and run it



2. **First run**

   - Click Pairing (Listening) to start the initial setup of the Listener.
   ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: IF error message pops up, please restart the app, rightclick on the button and click on "Try Pairing with Edge".

   - A browser popup will ask you to **pair with Companion** (Facepunch)

     let it run until it's set up (needed only once)

   - Click on "**Login with Steam**" and authorize your local PC to Steam (localhost)  

   - Allow the connection → your Steam account is linked



4. **Pair a server**  

   - In the app, click **Listening (Pairing)**  

   - In *Rust*, click the **Rust+ Pairing Link**  

   - The server will appear automatically in the app



5. **Connect**  

   - Select the server and click **Connect**  

   - Future sessions won’t require another Steam login


6. **Smart Devices**  

   - While connected, pair a device or server in-game → it appears instantly in the app

7. **If the FCM Listener won't start after a while of using the app**
   - you probably have to do the Pairing Process again.
   - Rightclick the Pairing button and select "Delete Config + Pair".
   - That's it.

8. **Alternative manuall pairing**
   - You can do the pairing manually through PowerShell. 

   - Open PowerShell, 
   - Go to your installation folder (e.g. -> a: -> cd programs -> cd RustPlusDesk)
   - Then copy paste this Power Shell code to the console. (Press enter twice) This should pair manually and open a popup in browser:

$node = ".\runtime\node-win-x64\node.exe"
$cli  = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\RustPlusDesk\runtime\rustplus-cli\node_modules\@liamcottle\rustplus.js\cli\index.js"
$cfg  = "$env:APPDATA\RustPlusDesk\rustplusjs-config.json"

if (!(Test-Path $cli)) {
    $zip = ".\runtime\rustplus-cli.zip"
    $dst = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\RustPlusDesk\runtime\rustplus-cli"
    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $dst | Out-Null
    Expand-Archive -Path $zip -DestinationPath $dst -Force
}

& $node $cli fcm-register --config-file "$cfg"

## 🛠️ Why initial NCM registration is required:
<details> 
   <summary> NCM Registration Explanation </summary>
On first launch, the app needs to establish a connection to the Rust+ Companion API.
For this, a bundled Node.js process (rustplus-cli) is started, which takes care of two things:

**Registration with Facepunch/Steam**

   - Opens a browser window to the official Rust+ Companion login page.

   - After logging in with Steam, an auth token is generated and passed back to the app.

   - This token is saved in the app’s config file so the process only needs to be done once per installation.

**Local listener for callbacks and notifications**

   - The Node process starts a small HTTP server on localhost:<random port> to receive the auth token.

   - Afterwards, it continues running as a background listener to receive notifications (chat, alarms, events) via Google FCM and forward them to the app.

**Requirements for successful registration**

   - Node.js runtime and rustplus-cli are shipped with the app – no manual installation required.

   - Firewall/Antivirus must not block the Node process:

   - Local loopback (127.0.0.1) must be accessible for the callback port.

**Outbound connections must be allowed on:**

   - TCP 5228–5230 (Google FCM, mtalk.google.com)

   - TCP 443 (HTTPS to Steam, Facepunch, Google)

   - Browser redirect must be allowed (some security tools or proxies may block it).

   - A valid Steam login is required to complete the auth flow.

**👉 After successful registration, the token is stored at**
%APPDATA%\RustPlusDesk\rustplusjs-config.json.
You only need to re-register if this file is missing or corrupted.
  </details>
  
<details>
<summary>🔧 Troubleshooting Registration</summary>

If the initial pairing does not work (no browser window opens, or it keeps restarting):

- **Check if Node is running**  
  - Open *Task Manager* → *Details* → look for `node.exe`.  
  - Or run:  
    ```powershell
    tasklist | findstr node.exe
    ```

- **Check if a local port is listening**  
  - Run:  
    ```powershell
    netstat -ano | findstr LISTENING | findstr 127.0.0.1
    ```
  - You should see a `127.0.0.1:<port>` entry with the same PID as `node.exe`.  
  - If not: Firewall or antivirus may be blocking the local callback server.  

- **Check outbound connections**  
  Test if the required ports are open:  
  ```powershell
  Test-NetConnection mtalk.google.com -Port 5228
  Test-NetConnection companion-rust.facepunch.com -Port 443
  Test-NetConnection steamcommunity.com -Port 443
  All should return TcpTestSucceeded : True
- **Config reset**
If all else fails, close the app and delete:
%APPDATA%\RustPlusDesk\rustplusjs-config.json
On next launch the registration will run again.
